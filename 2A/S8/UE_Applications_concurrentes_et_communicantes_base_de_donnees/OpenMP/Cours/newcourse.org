* How to use this document

** What is org-mode

 This is org-mode document. Org-mode is a markup language which allows
 to write text documents containing executable code blocks.

 Org-mode can do much more than this and you can find out more [[https://orgmode.org][here.]]

 Org-mode works in emacs (the best editor in the world).

** Code blocks

 You can do two things with code blocks (besides simply reading them):

 1) execute: this can be done using the ~C-c C-c~ (Ctrl-c Ctrl-c) keybinding. The stdout of the code
    will be appended below the code block itself

 2) tangle: tangling a code block means creating a separate file that contains the code which can
    thus be compiled and run as usual. If you hit ~C-c C-v C-t~ (this call the emacs function
    ~org-babel-tangle~) all the code blocks in this file will be tangled. If, instead, you only want
    to tangle a single code blocks, go to that block and hit ~C-u C-c C-v C-t~

** Compiling and running a tangled code block

   Once you have tangled a code block, you can compile and run it like any other code. For the code
   blocks of this document to work, you have to use the following compile command:

#+begin_src sh
gcc -fopenmp -I. aux.c code_block.c -o code_block
#+end_src

   And then you can run it by launching the ~code_block~ executable

#+begin_src sh
./code_block
#+end_src


** Some other useful tricks

   - *Set an environment variable*: in order to set an environment variable within emacs you have to
     hit ~M-x setenv~ then write the name of the variable, hit enter, write its value and hit enter again

   - *Refresh images in an org-mode document*: if images don't show up, use the command ~M-x
     org-redisplay-inline-images~

   - *Show this document as a presentation*: to show this document as a sequence of slides, you must
     install the emacs ~org-tree-slide~ package. Then open the document and execute the command ~M-x
     org-tree-slide-mode~. You can mode forward and backward using the ~>~ and ~<~ keys. The setup
     code at the bottom of this file should automagically install this package upon opening

   - *Export and org-mode document*: Org-mode lets you export org-mode documents in various formats
     such as pdf or html. Just hit ~C-c C-e~ and follow the instructions.

   - When you open this document, the code block at the bottom (in the Setup section) is supposed to be executed
     automatically to setup your environment. If this does not happen (it may be the case in older
     emacs version), just go there and hit ~C-c C-c~ to execute it manually. Also, the two code
     blocks named ~auxc~ and ~auxh~ are supposed to be tangled automatically. If this does not
     happen, do it manually.


   
* Introduction

** Parallel computer architectures
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
[[file:figures/par_arch.png]]


   Roughly speaking, parallel computers can be classified into two types:

   1) *Shared memory*: all the CPUs share one (logical) memory, i.e., all processes can access the
      same addressing space regardless of the CPU they are running on. This makes it simple to
      communicate data from one process to another

   2) *Distributed memory*: the computer is actually formed of multiple node, each having one or more
      CPUs and its own memory. Nodes are connected through a network. A process running on one node
      can only access data on the local memory; therefore, if it needs data that is on another node,
      a message must be exchanged through the network




** Shared memory: SMP vs NUMA


   One "logical memory" does not necessarily mean that only one physical memory exists. If multiple
   memory modules exist, access to data may non-uniform
   
   - Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP): all CPUs can access to all data with the same bandwidth and
     latency
   - Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA): all CPUs can access to all data but bandwidth and latency
     depends on where the data is placed

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 300px
 [[file:figures/numa.png]]     

   Both types of shared-memory architectures can be programmed using the same tools and
   technologies. When performance is a concern, though, special care must be taken for NUMA machines
   (we will not cover in this course)


** Multicore processors: why?


   Until the early 00's all processors had only one core (in fact we did not use the word "core" at
   all). Then why have multicore processors become ubiquitous? Energy consumption is the reason why:

   $P=CV^2f$

   however there is a linear dependence between $f$ and $V$, therefore $P$ grows as the cube of
   $f$!!!

   Because the performance of single-core processors could only be improved by increasing the
   frequency, this trend became unsustainable.

   Multicore processors design relies on *Thread Level Parallelism* to improve performance. This
   means that more transistors are used to assemble multiple execution units (i.e., cores) on a
   single chip. This improves performance with only a linear increase in the energy consumption: the
   capacitance $C$ grows because of the increased number of transistors.

   In fact, it is also possible to produce faster processors which consume less energy!!! Consider a
   quad-core processor with frequency $0.6f$: it will be 2.4 times faster and consume roughly 15\%
   less energy

** Multicore processors: why?

   [[file:figures/procs_history.png]]



** Multicore architecture

Multicore computer: what does it look like?

The ~hwloc~ library is designed to retrieve all the details of the architecture. For example, on my
computer, I can run the ~lstopo~ program from ~hwloc~ to retrieve the architecture:


#+begin_src sh :tangle no :results file :file ./figures/arch.png
ssh plafrim lstopo --of png 
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px



** How to program multicore computers?

Many options exist, but they are not all simple, portable, efficient etc.

Examples:

- *pThreads* (POSIX Threads): difficult to use and debug, not fully portable

- *Intel TBB/OneAPI*: proprietary

- *Cilk*: limited support and portability

- *OpenMP*: extremely portable, efficient, relatively easy to use. huge community and support





* The OpenMP standard

** Basic ideas and components
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
   [[file:figures/openmp_logo.png]]


   *OpenMP* (Open specifications for MultiProcessing) is an Application Program Interface (API) to
   explicitly direct multi-threaded, shared memory parallelism.

   - First standard 1.0 was published in 1997

   - Latest standard is 5.2 published in November 2021

     - Full specs are at this [[https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/OpenMP-API-Specification-5-2.pdf][URL]]

     - Examples and exercises are at this [[https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/openmp-examples-5.2.1.pdf][URL]]

   - Many resources at https://www.openmp.org

   The OpenMP standard is developed by an advisory board that includes many members from academia
   (UTK, LBNL, ANL, NASA,...) and industry (Intel, AMD, NEC, Fujitsu, NVIDIA,...)


   
** Basic ideas and components
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
   [[file:figures/openmp_logo.png]]

   
   - OpenMP is Comprised of three primary API components:
     1) *Language directives*
     2) *Runtime library routines*
     3) *Environment variables*

   - Portable:
     - Specifications for C/C++ and Fortran
     - Already available on many systems (including Linux, Win, IBM, SGI etc.)


** Disclaimer
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px
   [[file:figures/openmp_logo.png]]
   
   This course does not cover the whole OpenMP standard.  The OpenMP manual is over 600 pages as of
   today (v5.2)

   Only a subset of constructs and clauses will be presented.

   Tons of tutorials can be found online but better be used with moderation.


** Fork-join execution model
   OpenMP is based on a fork-join execution model:
   
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
   [[file:figures/forkjoin.png]]
   
   - Execution is started by a single thread called master thread

   - when a parallel region is encountered, the master thread spawns a set of threads

   - the set of instructions enclosed in a parallel region is executed

   - at the end of the parallel region all the threads synchronize and terminate leaving only the
     master
  


   

* Parallel region

** Parallel region directive syntax

#+begin_example
  #pragma omp parallel [clause]
                       if (scalar or logical expression)
                       private(list)
                       firstprivate(list)
                       shared(list)
                       default(private | shared | none)
                       reduction(operator:list)
                       num_threads(scalar integer expression)
  {
    /* Structured code block */
  }
#+end_example

- The *master* is a member of the team and has thread number 0

- Starting from the beginning of the region, the code is duplicated and all threads will execute
  that code.

- There is an *implied barrier* at the end of a parallel section.

- If any thread terminates within a parallel region, all threads in the team will terminate.



** A simple hello world example in OpenMP

   Just a simple hello world with multiple threads:

   - start with serial execution

   - open a parallel region where:
     - each thread prints a message

 #+begin_src C :tangle hello_world.c 
   #pragma omp parallel
   {
     printf("Hello world!\n");
   }
 #+end_src


** A slightly more complex hello world example in OpenMP

   Just a simple hello world with multiple threads:

   - start with serial execution

   - open a parallel region where:
     - each thread reads its identifier and the total number of threads using, respectively, the
       ~omp_get_thread_num()~ and ~omp_get_num_threads()~
     - prints a message

 #+begin_src C :tangle hello_world_ids.c 
   #pragma omp parallel
   {
     printf("Hello world from thread %2d in a pool of %2d.\n", omp_get_thread_num(), omp_get_num_threads());
   }
 #+end_src

 #+RESULTS:
 : Hello world from thread  0 in a pool of  8.
 : Hello world from thread  3 in a pool of  8.
 : Hello world from thread  6 in a pool of  8.
 : Hello world from thread  7 in a pool of  8.
 : Hello world from thread  4 in a pool of  8.
 : Hello world from thread  2 in a pool of  8.
 : Hello world from thread  1 in a pool of  8.
 : Hello world from thread  5 in a pool of  8.





** Parallel region: how many threads?

   How many threads do we have in the parallel regions of a code? The
   number of threads depends on:

   - Evaluation of the ~if~ clause (one or many)
    
   - Setting of the ~num_threads~ clause
    
   - Use of the ~omp_set_num_threads()~ library function
    
   - Setting of the ~OMP_NUM_THREADS~ environment variable
    
   - Implementation default - usually the number of CPUs on a node,
     though it could be dynamic



** Parallel region: how many threads?

   Complete example

 #+begin_src C :tangle num_threads.c 
   int iam, nth, n=4;

   #pragma omp parallel
   {
     printf("Region 1 thread %2d / %2d.\n", omp_get_thread_num(), omp_get_num_threads());
   }

   omp_set_num_threads(n);
   
   #pragma omp parallel
   {
     printf("Region 2 thread %2d / %2d.\n", omp_get_thread_num(), omp_get_num_threads());
   }

   #pragma omp parallel num_threads(2)
   {
     printf("Region 3 thread %2d / %2d.\n", omp_get_thread_num(), omp_get_num_threads());
   }

   #pragma omp parallel if(n<5)
   {
     printf("Region 4 thread %2d / %2d.\n", omp_get_thread_num(), omp_get_num_threads());
   }


#+end_src

** Hello world with a bug

   Here is a minor variant of the hello world program...with a bug

 #+begin_src C :tangle hello_world_bug.c 
   int iam, nth;

   #pragma omp parallel
   {
     iam = omp_get_thread_num();
     nth = omp_get_num_threads();
     do_stuff(1);
     printf("Hello world from thread %d in a pool of %2d.\n", iam, nth);
   }
 #+end_src

 
 
** Data sharing 1/2

- Most variables are shared by default

- Global variables include:
  - Fortran: COMMON blocks, SAVE and MODULE variables
  - C: File scope variables, static

- Private variables include:
  - Loop index variables (in !$OMP DO) constructs
  - Stack variables in subroutines called from parallel regions

- Fortran: Automatic variables within a statement block

- The OpenMP Data Scope Attribute Clauses are used to explicitly define how variables should be
  scoped. They include:
  - ~private~
  - ~firstprivate~
  - ~shared~
  - ~default~
  - ~reduction~


** Data sharing 2/2

- ~private(list)~: a new object of the same type is created for each thread (uninitialized!)

- ~firstprivate(list)~: Listed variables are initialized according to the value of their original
  objects prior to entry into the parallel or work-sharing construct.

- ~lastprivate(list)~: The value copied back into the original variable object is obtained from the
  last (sequentially) iteration or section of the enclosing construct.

- ~shared(list)~: only one object exists in memory and all the threads access it

- ~default(shared|private|none)~: sets the default scoping

- ~reduction(operator:list)~: performs a reduction on the variables that appear in its list.


** Hello world bugfix

   Let's fix the bug: by declaring ~iam~ private, each thread will have its own copy of this
   variable

 #+begin_src C :tangle hello_world_bugfix.c 
   int iam, nth;

   #pragma omp parallel private(iam)
   {
     iam = omp_get_thread_num();
     nth = omp_get_num_threads();
     do_stuff(1);
     printf("Hello world from thread %d in a pool of %2d.\n", iam, nth);
   }
 #+end_src


* Work distribution and sharing

** Dependencies
*** Dependencies
    The interest of parallel programming is not to execute the same workload multiple times but to
    distribute the workload to the available processes so that execution time can be reduced. This
    implies that multiple instructions will be executed *concurrently* (or, equivalently, *in
    parallel*).

    Two successive statements S1 and S2 can be executed concurrently if they are
    *independent*. According to the *Bernstein conditions* there exist three types of dependencies:

    - *Read-After-Write* or *true dependency* or *flow dependency*: if ~Input(S2)~ overlaps with
      ~Output(S1)~

    - *Write-After-Read* or *anti-dependency*: if ~Output(S2)~ overlaps with ~Input(S1)~

    - *Write-After-Write* or *output dependency*: if ~Output(S2)~ overlaps with ~Output(S1)~


*** Dependencies

   Example. Are these two statements independent?

 #+begin_src C :tangle no
   a = b+c;
   e = d+a;
 #+end_src

   What kind of dependency is there? RAW. Here is a more convoluted example

 #+begin_src C :tangle no
   for(i=1; i<n; i++)
     x[i] += x[i-1];
 #+end_src

*** Dependencies

    Example. Are these two statements independent?

 #+begin_src C :tangle no
   a = b+c;
   b = c*2;
 #+end_src

   What kind of dependency is there? WAR. Note that WAR dependencies
   can be sometimes removed!

 #+begin_src C :tangle no
   d = b;
   a = d+c;
   b = c*2;
 #+end_src

   Now the second and third statement have become independent. Here is
   a more convoluted example

 #+begin_src C :tangle no
   for(i=0; i<n-1; i++)
     x[i] += x[i+1];
 #+end_src


*** Dependencies

    Example. Are these two statements independent?

 #+begin_src C :tangle no
   c = a+b;
   c = 2;
 #+end_src

   What kind of dependency is there? WAW. Here is a more convoluted
   example

 #+begin_src C :tangle no
   for(i=0; i<n; i++)
     c += x[i];
 #+end_src


** Master 

   The ~master~ directive identifies a code block which is only executed
   by the master thread

#+begin_src C :tangle master.c 
    int iam;

  #pragma omp parallel private(iam)
    {
      iam = omp_get_thread_num();

  #pragma omp master
      {
        do_stuff(0.1);
        printf(" ---> This is only done by: %2d\n",iam);
      }
      printf("      This is also done by: %2d.\n",iam);
    }
#+end_src
   

** Single 

   The ~single~ directive identifies a code block which is only executed
   by one (any) thread

#+begin_src C :tangle single.c 
    int iam;

  #pragma omp parallel private(iam)
    {
      iam = omp_get_thread_num();

  #pragma omp single
      {
        do_stuff(0.1);
        printf(" ---> This is only done by: %2d\n",iam);
      }
      printf("      This is also done by: %2d.\n",iam);
    }
#+end_src


** Single vs master

   One obvious difference between ~single~ and ~master~ is that with ~master~ only the thread with
   id 0 can execute the code block. This has a risk: you have to make sure that the master thread
   passes by that code block otherwise it will never be executed.

   Can you spot any other difference from executing the two code blocks above? There is an *implied
   barrier* at the end of the ~single~ block. It can be removed using the ~nowait~ clause
   
#+begin_src C :tangle single_nowait.c 
    int iam;

  #pragma omp parallel private(iam)
    {
      iam = omp_get_thread_num();

  #pragma omp single nowait
      {
        do_stuff(0.1);
        printf(" ---> This is only done by: %2d\n",iam);
      }
      printf("      This is also done by: %2d.\n",iam);
    }
#+end_src
   



** Parallel loops

*** Parallel

    In the code below, all the iterations in the loop are *independent*. This means that they can be
    executed *concurrently*. However the code below is wrong because it does not produce the same
    result as in sequential

  #+begin_src C :tangle loops.c
    int i, n=4;
    int a[n], b[n], c[n];

    #pragma omp parallel private(i)
    {

      for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
        printf("Thread %2d does iteration %2d\n",omp_get_thread_num(),i);
        a[i] += b[i]+c[i];
      }
    }
  #+end_src



*** Parallel

    OpenMP provides a construct that automatically parallelizes loops by executing chunks of
    iterations concurrently. Note that the loop index ~i~ is implicitly ~private~.

  #+begin_src C :tangle loops.c
    int i, n=4;
    int a[n], b[n], c[n];

    #pragma omp parallel
    {
    #pragma omp for
      for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
        printf("Thread %2d does iteration %2d\n",omp_get_thread_num(),i);
        a[i] += b[i]+c[i];
      }
    }
  #+end_src


*** Schedule

    The ~schedule~ clause in the ~for~ construct specifies how the iterations of the loop are
    assigned to threads:

    - ~static~: loop iterations are divided into pieces of size chunk and then statically assigned
      to threads in a round-robin fashion

    - ~dynamic~: loop iterations are divided into pieces of size chunk, and dynamically scheduled
      among the threads; when a thread finishes one chunk, it is dynamically assigned another

    - ~guided~: for a chunk size of 1, the size of each chunk is proportional to the number of
      unassigned iterations divided by the number of threads, decreasing to 1. For a chunk size with
      value k (greater than 1), the size of each chunk is determined in the same way with the
      restriction that the chunks do not contain fewer than k iterations

    - ~runtime~: The scheduling decision is deferred until runtime by the environment variable OMP
      SCHEDULE

*** Schedule
  Let's see how ~schedule~ works:

  #+name: scheds
  #+begin_src C :tangle scheds.c :results file :file res.data
    int i;
    #pragma omp parallel for num_threads(4) schedule(static,25)
    for (i=0; i<400; i++)
      printf("%3d  %2d\n",i,omp_get_thread_num());
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: scheds
  [[file:res.data]]

  #+begin_src gnuplot :var data=scheds   :results file :file ./figures/scheds.png
  reset
  set term png size 700, 400
  set xlabel "iterations"
  set ylabel "thread"
  set yrange [-0.5:3.5]
  set ytics 0,1,3
  set grid ytics lt 1 lc 'gray80'
  plot "res.data" with points pt 6 title 'Iteration'

  set output

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:./figures/scheds.png]]


  
* Threads synchronization


** Barriers
*** Barrier

    A barrier is simply a waiting point: all threads must wait for all the others to reach a barrier
    point before moving on. Example

 #+begin_src C :tangle barrier.c 
     int iam;
     double t=secs();
   #pragma omp parallel private(iam)
     {
       iam = omp_get_thread_num();

       if(iam==0){
	 do_stuff(0.5); // 0.5 seconds
       } else {
	 do_stuff(0.3); // 0.3 seconds
       }
   #pragma omp barrier
       printf("Thread %2d reached this point at time %f.\n",iam,secs()-t);
     }
 #+end_src
   

*** Barrier

    Improper use of barriers can cause *deadlocks*: if not all threads pass by the barrier, those
    who do will be waiting forever...

 #+begin_src C :tangle barrier_deadlock.c 
     int iam;
     double t=secs();
   #pragma omp parallel private(iam)
     {
       iam = omp_get_thread_num();

       if(iam==0){
	 do_stuff(0.5);
       } else {
	 do_stuff(0.3);
         #pragma omp barrier
       }

       printf("Thread %2d reached this point at time %f.\n",iam,secs()-t);
     }
 #+end_src



** Critical sections
*** Critical

 The ~critical~ directive identifies a code block which is executed in *mutual exclusion* by all
 threads, i.e., one at a time.

 #+begin_src C :tangle critical.c 
     int iam;
     double t=secs();

   #pragma omp parallel private(iam)
     {
       iam = omp_get_thread_num();

   #pragma omp critical
       {
         do_stuff(0.1);
         printf("This is done by %2d  at time %f\n",iam, secs()-t);
       }
     }
 #+end_src


*** Critical scope

 Critical sections can have names. The name argument is used to identify the critical construct. For
 any critical construct for which name is not specified, the effect is as if an identical
 (unspecified) name was specified. It is not possible to have two or more threads in different
 critical regions that have the same name!


 #+begin_src C :tangle critical_names.c 
     int iam;
     double t=secs();

   #pragma omp parallel private(iam)
     {
       iam = omp_get_thread_num();

   #pragma omp critical (toti)
       {
         do_stuff(0.1);
         printf("First  is done by %2d  at time %f\n",iam, secs()-t);
       }

   #pragma omp critical (toto)
       {
         do_stuff(0.1);
         printf("Second is done by %2d  at time %f\n",iam, secs()-t);
       }
     }
 #+end_src


** Atomic instructions

*** Atomic

    The atomic construct ensures that a specific storage location is accessed atomically so that
    possible simultaneous reads and writes by multiple threads do not result in indeterminate
    values. Five types of atomic constructs exist: ~read~, ~write~, ~update~, ~capture~ and
    ~compare~

    - ~read~: atomically read a memory location, i.e., ~x~ can not change while being read
    
  #+begin_src C :tangle no 
      int x, v;

    #pragma omp parallel
      {
        #pragma atomic read
        v = x;
      }
  #+end_src



*** Atomic

    - ~write~: atomically write a memory location

    - ~update~: atomically update (i.e. read-modify-write) a memory location

    So what's the interest of atomic? take this example: we could certainly use ~critical~ to
    protect the update of ~x[]~ but this would prevent calls to ~compute_one~ to be executed
    concurrently. With ~atomic~ only the update of ~x[]~ is serialized.

  #+begin_src C :tangle atomic_update.c 
    double t_start=secs(), t_end;
    int i, n=100, m=5, tot=0, x[5]={0,0,0,0,0};

  #pragma omp parallel for
      for(i=0; i<n; i++){
  #pragma omp atomic update
        x[rnd_int()%m] += compute_one(0.01);
      }
    t_end = secs()-t_start;

    for(i=0; i<m; i++)
      tot += x[i];
    printf("\nTot:%10d   time:%f\n",tot, t_end);
  #+end_src




*** Atomic 

    - ~capture~: atomically update a memory location and capture its initial or final value

  #+begin_src C :tangle no 
      int x, v, y, w;

    #pragma omp parallel
      {
        /* Capture initial value */
        #pragma atomic capture
        v = x++;

        /* Capture final value */
        #pragma atomic capture
        w = ++y;

      }
  #+end_src
      
*** Atomic

    - ~compare~: atomically and conditionally update a memory location

  #+begin_src C :tangle atomic_compare.c 
    int i, n=1000, min=99999999;
    int x[n];  

    rand_fill(x, n);

    #pragma omp parallel for
    for(i=0; i<n; i++){
      #pragma omp atomic compare
      if (x[i] < min) { min = x[i]; }
      }

    printf("Min is %d\n",min);

  #+end_src


** Reductions
*** Reductions

    Assume this simple code that computes the sum of all the elements of an array

   #+begin_src C :tangle no 
     int i, sum, n=1000;
     int x[n];  

     rand_fill(x, n); sum=0;

     for(i=0; i<n; i++){
        sum += x[i];
     }

     printf("Sum is %d\n",sum);

   #+end_src


   The iterations of this loop are clearly dependent because of the updates on ~sum~. We could
   actually use a critical section or an atomic update but we would loose all performance.

*** Reductions

    *Reductions* allow us to take advantage of associativity and commutativity of some operators (+
    in this case):

   #+begin_src C :tangle reduction.c 
     int i, sum, n=1000;
     int x[n];  

     rand_fill(x, n); sum=0;

 #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum)
     for(i=0; i<n; i++){
        sum += x[i];
     }

     printf("Sum is %d\n",sum);

   #+end_src

   The reduction clause specifies an operator and one or more list items. For each list item, a
   private copy is created in each implicit task, and is initialized appropriately for the
   operator. After the end of the region, the original list item is updated with the values of the
   private copies using the specified operator.

*** Reductions

    For the ~C~ language, predefined reduction operators are (note that : in the table below is
    actually a | )
    
    |----------+-----------------+--------------------------------|
    | Operator | Initializer     | Combiner                       |
    |----------+-----------------+--------------------------------|
    | +        | omp_priv=0      | omp_out += omp_in              |
    | *        | omp_priv=1      | omp_out *= omp_in              |
    | ~        | omp_priv=~0     | omp_out ~= omp_in              |
    | :        | omp_priv=0      | omp_out := omp_in              |
    | ^        | omp_priv=0      | omp_out ^= omp_in              |
    | &&       | omp_priv=1      | omp_out  = omp_in && omp_out   |
    | ::       | omp_priv=0      | omp_out  = omp_in :: omp_out   |
    | max      | omp_priv=minval | omp_out  = max(omp_in,omp_out) |
    | min      | omp_priv=maxval | omp_out  = min(omp_in,omp_out) |
    |----------+-----------------+--------------------------------|






* Tasks

** Task

   The OpenMP ~task~ construct simply identifies a block of code which is ready to be executed and
   whose execution is *deferred*. Once the task is created, it can be executed *by any thread, at
   any time*. This means that we can not make any assumptions on when a task is executed and by
   which thread and in which order all the created tasks are executed.

#+begin_src C :tangle tasks_simple.c 
  #pragma omp parallel
  {
  #pragma omp master
    {
  #pragma omp task
      printf("Thead %2d does task 1\n",omp_get_thread_num());

  #pragma omp task
      printf("Thead %2d does task 2\n",omp_get_thread_num());

  #pragma omp task
      printf("Thead %2d does task 3\n",omp_get_thread_num());

  #pragma omp task
      printf("Thead %2d does task 4\n",omp_get_thread_num());
    }
  }
#+end_src

   Why do we need the ~master~ construct in the code above?




** Task data
   
   A slightly more complex example, with a bug:

 #+begin_src C :tangle no 
   int i;
   printf("Hello %p\n",&i);
   #pragma omp parallel
   {
   #pragma omp master
     {
       for(i=0; i<6; i++)
         {
   #pragma omp task
           printf("Thread  %d   iteration: %d\n", omp_get_thread_num(), i);
         }
     }
   }
 #+end_src

 What went wrong?


** Task data
   
   The value of shared variables accessed within a task might change between the creation of the
   task and its actual execution. Some clauses can be used to define the scope of variables within
   tasks:

   - ~shared(x)~ means that when the task is executed x is the same variable (the same memory
     location) as when the task was created

   - ~firstprivate(x)~ means that x is private to the task, i.e., when the task is created, a brand
     new variable x is created as well and its value is set to be the same as the value of x in the
     enclosing context at the moment when the task is created. This new copy is destroyed when the
     task is finished

   - ~private(x)~ means that x is private to the task, i.e., when the task is created, a brand new
     variable x is created as well. This new copy is destroyed when the task is finished

   If a variable is ~private~ in the parallel region it is implicitly ~firstprivate~ in the included
   tasks


** Task data
   
   A slightly more complex example, with a bugfix:

 #+begin_src C :tangle tasks_loop.c 
   int i;
   printf("Hello %p\n",&i);
   #pragma omp parallel
   {
   #pragma omp master
     {
       for(i=0; i<6; i++)
         {
   #pragma omp task firstprivate(i)
           printf("Thread  %d   iteration: %d\n", omp_get_thread_num(), i);
         }
     }
   }
 #+end_src


** Task if
   
   Creating and handling tasks has a cost. Therefore, it is not always worth creating a task, for
   example, if the task has only little work to do. The ~if~ clause can be used to choose whether to
   create a task or immediately run the code block

 #+begin_src C :tangle tasks_if.c 
   double w=0.4;

   #pragma omp parallel
   {
   #pragma omp master
     {
   #pragma omp task
       printf("Thread  %d executes this first task\n", omp_get_thread_num());

   #pragma omp task if(w>0.4)
       {
         do_stuff(w);
         printf("Thread  %d executes this second task\n", omp_get_thread_num());
       }

     }
   }
 #+end_src


** Taskwait
   
   So how can we be sure that some tasks are actually executed? The ~taskwait~ directive ensures
   that all the previously submitted tasks have been executed. Note that this does not include
   descendants, i.e., tasks that have been generated by other tasks.

 #+begin_src C :tangle taskwait.c 
   int x, y, z;

   #pragma omp parallel
   {
   #pragma omp master
     {
   #pragma omp task
       x = compute_one(0.2);

   #pragma omp task
       y = compute_one(0.2);

   #pragma omp taskwait
       z = x+y;
       printf("z is %d\n", z);
     }
   }
 #+end_src


** Task dependencies

   It is possible to define an execution order by specifying task *dependencies*. This is done
   through the ~depend~ clause and the Bernstein conditions:

   - The ~in~ dependence-type. The generated task will be a dependent task of all previously
     generated sibling tasks that reference at least one of the list items in an ~out~ or ~inout~
     dependence-type list.

   - The ~out~ and ~inout~ dependence-types. The generated task will be a dependent task of all
     previously generated sibling tasks that reference at least one of the list items in an ~in~,
     ~out~, or ~inout~ dependence-type list.



** Task dependencies

   Example:

 #+begin_src C :tangle task_dep.c 
   int a, b, c, x, y;
   double t=secs();
   #pragma omp parallel
   {
   #pragma omp master
     {
   #pragma omp task depend(out:a)
       a = f_a();

   #pragma omp task depend(out:b)
       b = f_b();

   #pragma omp task depend(out:c)
       c = f_c();

   #pragma omp task depend(in:b,c) depend(out:x)
       x = f_x(b, c);

   #pragma omp task depend(in:a,x) depend(out:y)
       y = f_y(a, x);

   #pragma omp taskwait
       printf("y: %d (correct value is 9) and time is %f\n",y,secs()-t);
     }
   }
 #+end_src

 Can you draw the dependency graph?


** Task priorities

   Assuming only two threads are available and all functions take one second, the following two
   schedulings are possible.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
[[file:figures/sched.png]]


** Task priorities

   The ~priority~ clause can be used to give the OpenMP scheduler a hint on the importance of a task

 #+begin_src C :tangle task_prio.c 
   int a, b, c, x, y;
   double t=secs();
   #pragma omp parallel
   {
   #pragma omp master
     {
   #pragma omp task depend(out:b) priority(2)
       b = f_b();

   #pragma omp task depend(out:c) priority(2)
       c = f_c();

   #pragma omp task depend(out:a)
       a = f_a();

   #pragma omp task depend(in:b,c) depend(out:x)
       x = f_x(b, c);

   #pragma omp task depend(in:a,x) depend(out:y)
       y = f_y(a, x);

   #pragma omp taskwait
       printf("y: %d (correct value is 9) and time is %f\n",y,secs()-t);
     }
   }
 #+end_src


** Task dependencies and pointers

   When using pointers to specify dependencies, you should dereference it to make sure the
   dependence is inferred from the pointed data rather than the pointer variable.

 #+begin_src C :tangle task_ptrs.c 
   int x[2]={0,0};
   int *p=x;
   double t=secs();
   #pragma omp parallel
   {
   #pragma omp master
     {
   #pragma omp task firstprivate(p) depend(out:*p)
       *p = compute_one(1.0);

       p+=1;

   #pragma omp task firstprivate(p) depend(out:*p)
       *p = compute_one(1.0);

   #pragma omp taskwait
       printf("x: {%d,%d} (correct value is {1,1}) and time is %f\n",x[0],x[1],secs()-t);
     }
   }
 #+end_src



* Locks

** Locks

   A lock is a data of type ~omp_lock_t~ which can be used to prevent simultaneous access to shared
   resources according to the schema

   - acquire (or set or lock) the lock

   - access data

   - release (on unset or unlock) the lock

   Acquisition of the lock is exclusive in the sense that only one threads can hold the lock at a
   given time. A lock can be in one of the following states:

   - *uninitialized*: the lock is not active and cannot be acquired/released by any thread;

   - *unlocked*: the lock has been initialized and can be acquired by any thread;

   - *locked*: the lock has been acquired by one thread and cannot be acquired by any other thread
     until the owner releases it.


** Locks

   Transitions through states can be achieved with the following routines

   - ~omp_init_lock~: initializes a lock

   - ~omp_destroy_lock~: uninitializes a lock

   - ~omp_set_lock~: waits until a lock is available, and then sets it

   - ~omp_unset_lock~: unsets a lock

   - ~omp_test_lock~: tests a lock, and sets it if it is available


** Locks

   Example
   
#+begin_src C :tangle locks_set.c 
  omp_lock_t lock;
  omp_init_lock(&lock);

  #pragma omp parallel
  {
    omp_set_lock(&lock);
    printf("%d: It's my turn to use the resource\n",omp_get_thread_num());
    use_resource();
    omp_unset_lock(&lock);
  }

  omp_destroy_lock(&lock);
#+end_src


** Locks

   Example with test lock
   
#+begin_src C :tangle locks_test.c 
  omp_lock_t lock;
  omp_init_lock(&lock);

  #pragma omp parallel
  {

    while(!omp_test_lock(&lock)){
      /* if lock is already locked, I do some other useful stuff */
      printf("%d: lock is busy, I do some stuff\n",omp_get_thread_num());
      do_stuff(0.5);
    }

    printf("%d: It's my turn to use the resource\n",omp_get_thread_num());
    use_resource();
    omp_unset_lock(&lock);
  }

  omp_destroy_lock(&lock);
